## 🧠 Agentic AI: Intelligent Travel Planner

### 📌 Overview
Agentic AI: Intelligent Travel Planner is a multi-agent AI system that automates end-to-end travel itinerary planning. It leverages autonomous agents to gather, process, and coordinate real-time data from multiple sources—flights, hotels, weather, and local events—to create optimized and personalized travel plans.

### 🚀 Features
- ✈️ Real-time flight and hotel integration
- 🤖 Autonomous multi-agent architecture

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI  
- **AI/LLM**: Gemini LLM, CrewAI  
- **Others**: REST APIs (for flights, hotels, etc.), JSON, Webhooks

### 📚 How It Works
1. **User Input**: Users provide travel details through natural language or form.
2. **Agent Activation**: Agents (flight agent, hotel agent, activity agent, etc.) fetch and process relevant data.
